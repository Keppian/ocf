												</h2>
											</header>
											
											<p><span class = "hover-underline"><strong>Organizational Condition</strong></span> decomposition and probe design are not about directly solving problems. Their purpose is to understand <strong>how a complex system is primed to respond</strong> when it is gently disturbed.</p>
											
											<p>It’s like dropping water onto a hot plate: the droplets dance, merge, and evaporate in unpredictable ways. You can’t forecast each movement, but you can <strong>observe the patterns</strong>: how energy, surface tension, and temperature interact to produce momentary order.</p>
											
											<p>In the same way, probes reveal <strong>how an organization self-organizes</strong> under different conditions. By watching which patterns stabilize, spread, or dissolve, we begin to sense where the system’s <strong>probabilities and propensities</strong> lie. From there, we can adjust the surrounding environment - the constraints, incentives, or narratives - to shift those propensities and make certain outcomes more likely, without assuming control or prediction.</p>
																						
											<p>Traditional problem-solving assumes that outcomes follow clear cause-and-effect chains:</p>

											<p class="orgConBlue">1 Identify the problem<br>
											2 Find the (root) cause<br>
											3 Apply the fix<br>
											4 Measure improvement</p>

											<p>In complex systems, such as teams and organizations, this approach fails because causes are interdependent and constantly shifting. You can’t fix culture, trust, or motivation in an organization the way you fix a timing belt on an engine, for example. What you <em>can</em> do is observe how the system behaves when you gently disturb it, and learn from those responses.</p>
			
										
											<p class="orgConBlue">1 Identify a pattern<br>
											2 Map the related Organizational Conditions<br>
											3 Run safe-to-fail probes in parallel<br>
											4 Observe the impact on the system<br>
											5 Amplify positive patterns and dampen anegative patterns</p>									

											<p>That is the essence of OC decomposition and probing: turning a broad issue into a field of smaller, safe-to-fail interventions that reveal how the system actually organizes itself.</p>

											<header>
												<h2 id="identify">Step 1: Identify the Macro/Meso Level Conditions<br/>
												</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Start with a <span class = "hover-underline"><strong>Storm</strong></span>, or a <span class = "hover-underline"><strong>Macro/Meso Level Organizational Condition</strong></span>. Remember, in OCF, Storms are concentrated manifestations of particular conditions that have reached notable intensity or scope. Ask, what recognizable or apparent organizational pattern feels problematic or puzzling.</p>
											
											<p>Examples:</p>										
								
											<p class="orgConBlue">Low estimation effectivess across teams<br/>
											High turnover in a single department<br/>
											Chronic meeting overload<br/>
											Low psychological safety during retrospectives<br/>
											</p>
								
											<p>State it as an Organizational Condition, using OCF syntax:</p>
								
											<p class="orgConBlue">"Low level of estimation effectiveness across engineering teams" rather than "Engineering teams are poor at estimation discipline."</span></li>

											<header>
												<h2 id="decompose">Step 2: Decompose the Organizational Conditions to See the System<br/>
												</h2>
											</header>
											
											<p>Break the meso-condition into micro-conditions — the smaller relational dynamics that might compose it. This is not about finding root causes; it’s about revealing what interacts.</p>
											
											<p>Ask:</p>
											
											<p class="orgConBlue">What behaviours or signals make this condition visible?<br/>
											Who or what (people, tools, policies, routines) seem to influence it?<br/>
											Where does variation appear... between teams, over time, under pressure?</p>

																			
											<p>Write about 8-15 subconditions such as:</p>
											
											<p class="orgConBlue">Frequency of interpreting estimates as performance commitments<br/>
											Degree of alignment on definition of estimation success<br/>
											Level of trust in feedback conversations</p>

											<p>You may explore the related subconditions for each of these. Continue to decompose until it no longer seems valuable to consider. You now have a map of interacting patterns, not a list of problems.</p>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<header>
												<h2 id="probes">Step 3: Design Small, Parallel Probes<br />
												</h2>
											</header>
											
											<p>Instead of launching one big initiative, design several small probes that each perturb a different micro-condition. A probe is a safe-to-fail intervention; modest in scope, short in duration, and <strong>designed to learn</strong>, not to prove.</p>
											
											<p>Example probes for estimation might include:</p>
											
											<p class="orgConBlue">Presenting estimates as ranges instead of fixed numbers.<br/>
											Making variance reviews team-based instead of individual.<br/>
											Temporarily removing estimation accuracy metrics from dashboards.<br/>
											Rotating estimation responsibilities among roles.
											</p>
											
											<p>Each probe should have clear boundaries (where it happens, how long it runs, who’s involved) and a plan for observing what changes.</p>

											<header>
												<h2 id="observe">Step 4: Observe Patterns, Not Success<br />
												</h2>
											</header>
											
											<p>After running probes, <strong>look for patterns of response</strong>, not success or failure.</p>

											<p>Ask:</p>
											
											<p class="orgConBlue">Which behaviours or attitudes increased or spread?<br/>
											Which dampened or disappeared?<br/>
											What surprised us?
											</p>
											
											<p>Compare across probes. You’re not evaluating performance, you’re <strong>sensing propensities</strong>: what the system tends to do under different conditions.</p>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<header>
												<h2 id="amplify">Step 5: Amplify and Damp<br />
												</h2>
											</header>
											
											<p>Once patterns appear:</p>
											
											<p class="orgConBlue"><strong>Amplify</strong> what seems generative: make it easier for that pattern to repeat.
											<strong>Dampen</strong> what reinforces tension or brittleness.
											</p>
											
											<p>Neither action is permanent; both are forms of ongoing tuning. Amplification and dampening are about encouraging or containing propensities, not scaling or erasing interventions.</p>

											<p>History of OCF</p>
										</header>
										
										<p>The Organizational Condition Framework (OCF) was created by Keppian over more than five years of development, drawing from complexity theory and real-world organizational practice. Designed as an interpretive framework rather than a prescriptive model, OCF helps organizations move beyond linear thinking and into the dynamics of emergence, real-time learning, and adaptive growth. It reflects Keppian’s commitment to guiding teams into spaces where curiosity drives insight and uncertainty becomes a catalyst for possibility.</p>
